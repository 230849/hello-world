# hello-world
I welcome you to my world. 

Hi humanity !

Jalona here, I am interested in the computer field and I am trying my best to undestand it. I see alot of people use Github. 
Right now I still do not understand but I hope so after this lesson. I like anyting music related, I play guitar, I love art, anime, and learning new things ^^
